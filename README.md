# Likhith-cybersecurity-portfolio

I am Likhith, a cybersecurity professional focused on defensive operations. I have hands-on experience with network analysis tools like Wireshark and nmap, and I'm comfortable in Linux environments, including Kali and BlackArch. I actively apply my skills by tracing and reporting phishing campaigns. I am seeking an analyst role where I can contribute to a Blue Team and am especially interested in how AI is being used to improve SIEM analysis and threat detection.
