### **System Description**

The server hardware consists of a powerful CPU processor and 128GB of memory. It runs on the latest version of Linux operating system and hosts a MySQL database management system. It is configured with a stable network connection using IPv4 addresses and interacts with other servers on the network. Security measures include SSL/TLS encrypted connections.

### **Scope**

The scope of this vulnerability assessment relates to the current access controls of the system. The assessment will cover a period of three months, from June 20XX to August 20XX. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 is used to guide the risk analysis of the information system.

### **Purpose**

The database server serves as the centralized hub for the organization’s critical information, storing massive amounts of customer profiles, campaign details, and analytical data. It is vital to secure this data to maintain the integrity of marketing operations and protect consumer privacy. If this server were disabled or compromised, the business would suffer immediate operational downtime, losing the ability to track performance or personalize marketing efforts, which would result in significant financial and reputational loss.

### **Risk Assessment**

| Threat Source | Threat Event | Likelihood | Severity | Risk |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Hacker** | Obtain sensitive information via exfiltration | 3 (High) | 3 (High) | **9 (High)** |
| **Employee** | Disrupt mission-critical operations | 2 (Moderate) | 3 (High) | **6 (Moderate)** |
| **Customer** | Alter/Delete critical information | 1 (Low) | 3 (High) | **3 (Low)** |

### **Approach**

I focused on **Hackers**, **Employees**, and **Customers** as the primary threat sources because the database server stores high-value data but currently operates with insufficient access restrictions. The threat event of "obtaining sensitive information via exfiltration" was deemed the highest risk because a data breach would be catastrophic to the company's competitive advantage and trust. Additionally, "disrupting operations" and "altering information" were selected as critical risks because the server is a centralized dependency; if internal users or customers accidentally or maliciously interfere with the data, daily marketing operations would immediately cease.

### **Remediation Strategy**

Implementation of authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users access the database server. This includes using strong passwords, role-based access controls, and multi-factor authentication to limit user privileges. Encryption of data in motion using TLS instead of SSL. IP allow-listing to corporate offices to prevent random users from the internet from connecting to the database.
