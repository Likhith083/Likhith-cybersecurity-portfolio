# **File Permissions in Linux: Environment Build & Security Audit**

### **Project Description**

# **To demonstrate my proficiency with Linux file system security, I designed a comprehensive simulation. I started by building a directory structure from scratch, simulating a real-world research environment. I then deliberately configured the file permissions to mimic a specific security scenario where unauthorized access was possible. Finally, I audited these permissions and applied the necessary corrections to enforce the Principle of Least Privilege. This project demonstrates my ability to create Linux resources, manipulate permission attributes, and secure sensitive data.**

### **Step 1: Building the Environment**

# **![][image1]**

# **The first step was to build the file structure. As shown in the screenshot above, I utilized foundational Linux commands to build the infrastructure:**

* # **mkdir projects: Created the main parent directory.**

* # **cd projects: Navigated into the directory.**

* # **touch ...: I used this to create empty files (project\_k.txt, project\_m.txt, etc.) to simulate the research data.**

* # **touch .project\_x.txt: I specifically added a period (.) before the filename to create a hidden file, simulating a sensitive configuration or archive file.**

* # **ls \-la: Finally, I ran a list command with the \-la flags to verify that all files—including the hidden one—were created successfully.**

### **Step 2: Configuring the Security Scenario**

# **![][image2]**

# **To match the requirements of the security audit scenario, I needed to configure the files with specific "unsafe" permissions (simulating a system that needs fixing).**

* # **chmod 666...: I used Octal mode to quickly set project\_k.txt so that "Other" users had write access.**

* # **chmod 620...: I configured the hidden file so the group had write access.**

* # **chmod 710...: I configured the drafts directory to allow the group to execute (enter) it.**

* # **ls \-la: I ran this command to confirm the environment was now in the specific state required for the audit. This output reveals the security gap: project\_k.txt is writable by everyone (\-rw-rw-rw-).**

### **Describe the permissions string**

# **To manage the security of the files, I analyzed the 10-character permission string generated by the system.**

# **Example from my project: project\_t.txt showed permissions of \-rw-rw-r--.**

* # **1st Character (\-): This indicates the file type (Regular file).**

* # **2nd-4th Characters (rw-): These represent the User (Owner). The owner has Read and Write access.**

* # **5th-7th Characters (rw-): These represent the Group. Members of the group also have Read and Write access.**

* # **8th-10th Characters (r--): These represent Other (anyone else on the system). They have only Read access.**

### **Change file permissions**

# **I established a security policy that "Other" users should never have write access to project files. My audit revealed project\_k.txt had write permissions enabled for everyone.**

# **![][image3]**

# **To secure the file, I used the chmod command as shown in the screenshot above.**

* # **Command: chmod o-w project\_k.txt**

* # **Breakdown: I selected o (Other) and subtracted (-) the w (Write) permission.**

* # **Verification: I immediately ran ls \-la to confirm the permissions string updated from \-rw-rw-rw- to \-rw-rw-r--.**

### **Change file permissions on a hidden file & directory**

# **Finally, I needed to secure the archived hidden file (.project\_x.txt) and restrict access to the drafts directory.**

# **![][image4]**

# **Securing the Hidden File:**

# **The .project\_x.txt file required strict permissions: "Read Only" for the group and not writable by anyone.**

* # **Command: chmod u-w,g-w,g+r .project\_x.txt**

* # **Explanation: In one line, I removed write access from User and Group, and added read access for the Group. The ls \-la output confirms the new permissions are \-r--r-----.**

# **Securing the Directory:**

# **The drafts directory should only be accessible by the owner.**

* # **Command: chmod g-x drafts**

* # **Explanation: I removed the Execute (x) permission from the Group. In Linux, removing execute permission from a folder prevents users from entering (cd) that folder. The final ls \-ld command confirms that the group permissions are now empty (\---), effectively locking the directory.**

### **Summary**

# **In this project, I successfully built a Linux file system from the ground up to simulate a security audit. I used creation commands (mkdir, touch) to structure the project and Octal chmod commands to replicate a vulnerable environment. I then rigorously applied the Principle of Least Privilege using symbolic chmod commands (like o-w and g-x). This process secured public files, protected hidden archives, and restricted access to sensitive directories, ensuring that only authorized users maintain access.**
